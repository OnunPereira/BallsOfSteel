# Balls of Steel

Every time you click inside the window, a ball will appear. But wait! That's no regular ball! Oh, no. It will fall, just like you would fall if your pet eagle grabbed you by the shoulders and dropped you mid-air. The only difference is that the ball bounces.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You'll need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed in order to experience this awesome "thing", for lack of a better word.
To verify that you indeed have it on your system, in a terminal window, run:

```
$ npm -v
```

You should get:

```
6.0.0
```
